# Sementac_Segmentation_MRI_Scans
Machine learning project using Python, TensorFlow and Keras

The task will be classifying each pixel in a cardiac MRI image based on whether the pixel is a part of the left ventricle (LV) or not

The data set you'll be utilizing is a series of cardiac images (specifically MRI short-axis (SAX) scans) that have been expertly labeled

We obtained guidance and partial code from a prior [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/details/deep-learning-tutorial) on how to extract the images properly.  At that point we took the images, converted them to TensorFlow records (TFRecords), and stored them to files.  [TFRecords](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/reading_data) are a special file format provided by TensorFlow, which allow you to use built-in TensorFlow functions for data management including multi-threaded data reading and sophisticated pre-processing of the data such as randomizing and even augmenting the training data

The images themselves are originally 256 x 256 grayscale [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) format, a common image format in medical imaging.  The label is a tensor of size 256 x 256 x 2.  The reason the last dimension is a 2 is that the pixel is in one of two classes so each pixel label has a vector of size 2 associated with it.  The training set is 234 images and the validation set (data NOT used for training but used to test the accuracy of the model) is 26 images
